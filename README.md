# Custom Figure Areas App
## Overview
This is a simple cross-platform app built using Microsoft's MAUI framework for drawing custom figures and calculating their areas. The app allows users to draw polygons on a canvas by tapping on the screen. The area of the drawn polygon is calculated and displayed in real-time as the user adds or removes points.

## Features
  * Drawing: Users can tap on the canvas to add points and draw a polygon.
  * Area Calculation: The app calculates the area of the drawn polygon using the shoelace formula.
  * Point Removal: If a point is tapped twice within a short duration, it is removed from the polygon.
  * Intersecting Lines Detection: The app prevents the creation of intersecting lines in the drawn polygon.

## Setup
To run the app:
  1. Make sure you have the necessary development environment set up for Microsoft's MAUI framework.
  2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  3. Open the solution in your preferred IDE.
  4. Build and run the solution.

## Requirements
  * .NET 6 or later
  * MAUI SDK

## Usage
